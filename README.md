# Imortant Notes
- level select screen doesn't work yet
- I made the mistake of not using inherited scenes
- I didn't put all the instance scenes in a folder (I would have changed that put it broke the test level)
- The code kinda sucks
- This was made to learn Godot. That's why it's extremely unorganized and a huge mess.
- This was built in 4.1.1 then ported to 4.3. Unfortunately, this broke the pause menu.
## "I want to add a new object/gamemode"
- Go ahead! I'm open to having people improve this, that's why I made it open source.
