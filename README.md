# Imortant Notes
- level select screen doesn't work yet
- I made the mistake of not using inherited scenes
- I didn't put all the instance scenes in a folder (I would have changed that put it broke the test level)
- The code kinda sucks
## "I want to add a new object/gamemode"
- Go ahead! I'm open to having people improve this, that's why I made it open source.
